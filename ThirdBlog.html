                    <p align="center" class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4"><font size="5">As per me information and the changes happening around us are very important. Like, our cyber security and the protection of our family. Now in this world we have such destructive creatures that are uncountable. Information regarding your awareness of different facts like cyber security. Information leads to awareness. A boy is not intelligent if he scores good marks in exams we can prove him smart by testing his general knowledge. Till then he doesn’t have any importance.<br><br>



                        Information leads to the social life. As we all know that man is a social animal. It is important in our day-to-day life. In this time we have many social media platforms. Does anyone wonder that, why they are being published on app stores. It’s not at all so difficult. "Yes, of course, to gain knowledge.”Social media is an informative platform, but it can turn deadly. We have used social media once in our life and we must have uploaded pics with the outside public. Social media is accessible to all and we don’t know that, who all are our well wishers. These messages can be misused easily by anyone. In a day, there are more than 1000 accounts which get hacked on instagram or facebook. It’s not about your honour but your privacy which is leaked in the hands of an unknown person. After hearing this news, many of you will send the messages about the estimated percentages of hacked accounts in a day. What, if the news is fake. Our constant habit of forwarding messages is also a great pain to the virtual world. Before sending a message, nobody thinks that the source of the message is a right  background or not, they also don’t think that the message can be fake. People just mean by forwarding. Privacy leakiness or fake info have made many of the people go into depression. Privacy is very important in this time. Many people commit suicides after leaking their privacy into other’s hands. This is really a serious matter. This is one of the most harming criminal activities.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        ‘Privacy has not the worth of gold.’<br><br>
                        
                        ‘Privacy has not the worth of diamond.’<br><br>
                        
                        ‘Privacy has the worth of life.’<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        ‘And a single worth of life is able to make thousand malls in our surroundings.’<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        ‘Information’ and ‘Fake information’ are different, similar like ‘Security’ and ‘Hacked’. Privacy cannot provide safety to us, its’s in other words is ourselves only. Security is important for all of us, our families and neighbours and every human in the world. It can provide a safe place to our privacy These two gangsters are sitting in our phones and are difficult to boycott. We said difficult, not ‘IMPOSSIBLE’. To fight with these we should not forward fake news, and take a regular account check - up to stop the crisis going on, regularly update passwords and adopt all the appropriate measures that can be taken to save thousands of lives.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        At last, we need to fight with this together. Situation of Corona Virus is not so deadly then this virtual virus. ‘Combat With These Deadly Mediums’ is to been adapted by each every one of us to make ourselves healthy physically and also virtually.<br><br>
