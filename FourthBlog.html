You be excellent in the field you work; you achieve success. Success doesnâ€™t come empty handed. It consists of blood and sweat of failure and strength. 
                        Following here is a self-composed poem on success :-<br><br>
                        
                        SUCCESS<br><br>
                        
                        
                                         
                        
                        Everyone wants to be successful in their life,<br>
                        But they missed something at it.<br><br>
                        
                        There is a topic also known as excellence,<br>
                        Which an only few knew about.<br><br>
                        
                        This makes something in our life very important,<br>
                        That is to make a thought of reaching on at high heights.<br><br>
                        
                        People only wants to get success,<br>
                        But the thought of being excellent is lacking behind.<br><br>
                        
                        The method of success is mug upped by everyone,<br>
                        But we need to clarify the mysteries of it.<br><br>
                        
                        This is all we need to do,<br>
                        To be an excellent, and illuminate it.<br><br>
                        
                        We all know that mug up is not a right way,<br>
                        But it is easy to follow.<br><br>
                        
                        So, the line is so vast for it,<br>
                        But the method of excellence has a short line<br><br>
                        
                        Following that will be tough,<br>
                        But it is fun to have such large obstacles in our life.<br><br>
                        
                                                                                 - Yash Mittal<br><br>   
                        
                        I think I have made my point much clear. We all should work hard instead of looking for a shortcut. Should study hard work on our passion, but by following the right way. Being innovative and finding a solution to a problem is inside every human, we need to find it.<br><br>
